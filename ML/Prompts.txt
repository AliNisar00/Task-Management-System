Framed as a critical exploration of the history and unfolding of Muslim nationalism in British India, write an approximately 7 page (between 1800 - 2200 words) essay on the “idea of Pakistan.” You are at substantial liberty to approach this task however you like so long as your discussion incorporates the broad historical sweep from at least 1857 - 1971, though mainly focused on the years between 1915 – 1947, during which period the idea of Pakistan formed and unfolded. The purpose of your essay is not to merely restate a chronological narrative, but rather to forge your own understanding of the way in which Pakistan was imagined, contested, and ultimately came into existence. While your essay should primarily be a summary and exposition of the key critical-historical narrative as it is presented in the texts and lectures, you should also, in part, offer an engagement with this narrative as well as an engagement with some of the critical conceptual frameworks you have been exposed to (e.g. the historicity of categories of analysis, essentialism (singular collective), historical contingency, imagined communities, the arbitrary, power relations (sovereignty) etc.). The purpose of your paper is not to justify, defend or critique the existence of the nation, or to justify/defend/celebrate Muslim/Pakistani nationalism in light of contemporary Hindutva.

All papers should be submitted on Turnitin on Canvas by Friday Oct 14th. Your papers should be about 6 pages long (1500 words). Papers should be submitted as Word documents, standard page size, double spaced, 12 point font.Choose one question from the following (all questions require you to draw mainly from materials (texts, lectures) that relate to the precolonial and early modern or Mughal period. (Readings & Lectures up until Oct 1st) Do not use any other sources or quote from other texts. Make sure to include your name, course section and chosen question at the beginning of your essay. Nationalist historiography often reads the long and complex history of the subcontinent as a struggle between Hindus and Muslims – one that inevitably leads to the event of partition and the formation of two nation states in 1947. Drawing from course materials (Jalal, Metcalf, articles, lectures, discussions), write an essay that touches on the “anachronism” and historicity of the categories we use in the historical analysis of India (“Hindu”, “Muslim,” etc.) Be sure to include in your essay some discussion on the history (historicity) of Urdu. How has Urdu come to be seen, in particular, as an Islamic or Muslim language, how does it figure into "partition" discourse, and what can you marshal from the texts and lectures that would offer counter points? (Note: Historicity suggests the historical, political and cultural embeddedness of human beings and recognizes the resulting prejudice of this embeddedness or framing. It implies a recognition of the historical variability of meaning, and the fundamentally interpretive nature of the past. Historicity also leads to the idea of historical difference, of ruptures and transformations in the basic understandings of the world, values and ideas. Anachronism is simply chronological misplacement… using an idea that belongs to the present to understand the past, where that idea or notion had completely different references or may not even have existed)

Throughout the 19th century, most of Western historiography has reproduced several misconceptions about the Mughal Empire that have deep political consequences. The triptych of Indian history (Hindu Age-Muslim Age-British/modern age), the idea of the Mughal Empire as a stagnant period, and portrayals of the Mughal Empire as a foreign/alien or Muslim government are now being challenged by many scholars. Based on the assigned readings and on the main lectures, write an essay discussing these misconceptions and explaining how they have contributed to legitimizing British rule and Hindu nationalism.
